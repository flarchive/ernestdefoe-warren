 * The score, the ranking, this reader's own vote, and the post preview.

 * 🚨 The vote fields are READ-ONLY and registered unconditionally, including on
 * a forum running fof/gamification.
 *
 * That is safe precisely because the schema is shared: `discussions.votes` and
 * the rank column are the same ones gamification maintains, so these fields
 * report the same numbers whoever last wrote them. Only the WRITE side — the
 * vote field and the control that calls it — stands down when gamification is
 * enabled, because two things writing the same row is the one arrangement that
 * would actually conflict.
 *
 * Reading unconditionally is what lets the row layout be the same code on both
 * kinds of forum. A control that only knew how to read its own extension's
 * field would need two renderers and they would drift.

     * extra queries to draw twenty arrows. `extend.php` eager-loads
     * `warrenVotes` already constrained to this actor, so by the time a field

     * The relation hangs off the discussion's own `first_post_id` rather than
     * off a loaded `firstPost`, which is why the vote costs ONE query even on
     * an endpoint carrying no posts at all.

     * It is constrained by ROW (`where user_id`), never by column. Narrowing
     * the columns of a relation other code can ask for is what put a null
     * `createdAt` into Flarum's store and blanked discussion pages in Cascade.
     * A relation Warren defines under its own name cannot collide that way,
     * and it still must not be column-narrowed.

     * not extend, or a model built in a console command. "I don't know" is the
     * honest answer there, and it renders as an un-voted control rather than
