             * `sumRelation` would be the obvious shape and it can only sum a
             * NUMERIC column. The direction is a number (`value`) on a forum
             * that has had gamification and a string ('Up'/'Down') on one that
             * has only run Warren — summing the second is meaningless. Two
             * counted subqueries answer the same question on both shapes with
             * no raw SQL and no branch in the renderer.
             *
             * Counting also costs no eager load: these are subqueries on the
             * post query itself, so a page of fifty comments is still one
             * round trip.
             *
             * 🚨 Each count reads its OWN relation rather than constraining a
             * shared one. Flarum buffers aggregates under a key built from the
             * column and the function, so two constrained counts over
             * `warrenVotes` would share a slot and the second would serialise
             * as null — a field that looks like it was never registered.
             *
             * The relations are also named apart from these FIELDS on purpose:
             * core resolves an aggregate by finding a field whose name equals
             * the relation name, so a field reading a relation of its own name
             * finds itself and every request for a post dies with a TypeError.
             * See the relations in extend.php.
